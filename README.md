# Asteroid-Futures

https://asteroid-futures.herokuapp.com/

This app was developed as a concept to provide accurate information about asteroids material value for potential investors. The app pulls information from the Asterank API (http://www.asterank.com/api), which itself is a thin layer over the NASA/JPL Small Body Database. The API returns information about the chemical make-up of each asteroid, and the estimated market value. For example a 'Type Xc' asteroid is primarily made up of platinum, nickel, iron, colbalt. With these material lists and the asteroid diameter, a rough estimate of the market value can be determined.


MAJOR COMPONENTS

HOME - This is the landing page, and helps to guide users moving forward. In V2 there will  be a more interactive/illustrated instruction palette so that users know immediately how the whole app works.

ASTEROIDS - This page showcases a curated selection of six asteroids. a photo of each is shown. Users can click on any image to see detailed information on that asteroid (name, diameter, type, estimated value and estimated profit).

TYPES - This page lists asteroid classifications and the materials of each classification. Asteroid V2 will feature a search bar that connects to a commodities API, so users can track the changing prices of each material.

PARTNERS - This page connects to various 'partners' (note: this is a conceptual project, asteroid futures does not currently work with any of the partners listed).
